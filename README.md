How will I complete this Project?

Review JavaScript design patterns and object-oriented JavaScript.
Review the Knockout.js framework.
Review and implement the Google Maps API.
Add map markers of interesting locations in the neighborhood.
Add a search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers.
	- There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
Implement a list view of the identified locations.
Add third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc).
