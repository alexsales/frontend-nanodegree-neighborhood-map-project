NEIGHBORHOOD MAP PROJECT (Art Galleries and Museums)
====================================================

Summary:

An app to help you identify local art galleries and museums.

====================================================

To Run the Application (for further development/non-production):

1. Clone repo into your local workstation:
	git clone https://github.com/alexsales/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map-project.git

2. Setup a local server on your workstation. For Windows users, checkout WAMP. For Mac (and possibly Linux) users, open a Terminal window and cd into your cloned directory. Then type the following command to create a temporary Python server:
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

3. Open a browser a window and in the address box (or URL bar), navigate to:
	localhost:8080

====================================================

Tools / Techniques:

* Knockout.js (a MVVM framework)
* Grunt.js (a task runner)
* Bower.js (a package manager)
* Concatenation (via Grunt and Bower)
* Google Maps API
* Flickr API
* Closures
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Object-Oriented JavaScript
* Map Icons Library (an external library)
* InfoBox Library (an external library)
* jQuery (an external library)
* Self-Documenting Code
* Media Queries and Responsive Web Design

====================================================

How will I complete this Project?

* Review JavaScript design patterns and object-oriented JavaScript.
* Review the Knockout.js framework.
* Review and implement the Google Maps API.
* Add map markers of interesting locations in the neighborhood.
* Add a search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
* Implement a list view of the identified locations.
* Add third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc).
